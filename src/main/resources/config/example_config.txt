#README!
#This is a configuration file for adjusting output of ErCorrector.
#Configuration is read using java.util.properties, viz https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Properties.html
#Every line consists of key - value pair. Keys are defined in ErCorrector.enums.DefectType
#Structure of value is dependent on key. Some keys need several values to function.
#Such as entity_count where a value consists of min : int, max : int, points : float.
#Value structure is described in a comment directly above the key-value pair.
#To disable correcting of certain defects set their value to "disable"
#i.e. to disable counting of attributes present in diagram - "attribute_ordinary = disable".
#Blank values such as "attribute_ordinary =     " are counted as being disabled.
#Missing configuration keys are enabled and counted as having default values.
#List of keys for basic defects - (can be only disabled or enabled)
#     - named_vertices
#     - no_duplicate_names
#List of usable keys, their default value and value structure:
#     - named_vertices
#     - no_duplicate_names
